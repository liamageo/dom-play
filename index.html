    <h2>Webpage Description:</h2>
    <p>This webpage is another demonstration of utilizing JavaScript and it's,
        different functions, methods, elements, and more. The theme for this project
        was taking scripts from plays or movies. I chose the Disney movie, "Moana"
        and my 4 script lines of choice came from Moana and her Grandmother Tala.
        I created a function called highlight, which allows each line to be highlighted.
        As a class, we also created a container in order to wire the elements. We created
        a div and id to store the elements.
        Using CSS descendant selectors were also part of this process, as well as attributes
        to specify which specific character/actor. This project was another great learning
        experience. It's important to be extremely careful of your spelling, I had mispelled
        the color yellow, which resulted in my webpage not functioning correctly.
